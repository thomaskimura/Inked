Email-Templates
===============

Here are some templates that have been built for use with [mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com/) and other email services.

View a live version of this template [here](http://thomaskimura.github.io/inked/).

### Steps

1. Download this repo
2. View `template.html` to see examples of how different elements were created
3. Make changes to template.html to fit your messaging
4. Copy and paste `template.html` into your email service
5. Make sure to replace line `9` with the entire contents of `style.min.css`
6. It should look something like
```html
<style>
  /*entire contents from style.min.css*/
</style>
```

Some email services require that you inline all your styles. This can be done using something like [this](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails/inliner.html).

1. Follow above steps and paste final code into the inliner tool
2. Resulting code should work almost everywhere!
